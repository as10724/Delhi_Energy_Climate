# Delhi_Energy_Climate
National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi is a political and administrative unit of the union of India comprising of New Delhi, the capital city of India, and its urban extentions. According to 2011 Census of India it had a population of 16.8 million. Delhi doesn't have heavy industry and agriculture which are dominant consumers of electricity at national level yet it is consuming more electricity than any of the following individual states: Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Kerala, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Sikkim and all states of the North-east. Delhiâ€™s residential energy consumption is makes up more than 52 per cent of electicity consumed in the city-state. The total energy consumed by Delhi households is more than that of all households in Gujarat, one of the richest states, with a population about three times that of Delhi.
Delhi is also known to exhibit higher seasonal variation in it electricity consumption compared to the national average. The month with the highest electricity consumption in Delhi accounts for 104 per cent more consumption than in the lowest consumption month, while at national level this number is just 15 per cent (LGBR 2017-18).
## This project is to analysis the relation between Delhi's climate and its energy concumption.
